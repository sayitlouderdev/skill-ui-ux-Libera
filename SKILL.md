# UI/UX Libera — Design Intelligence
*LIBERA Studio fork of ui-ux-pro-max v2.5.0 — updated May 2026*

Comprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. When local scripts are installed, provides access to 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 stacks. When scripts are unavailable, operates as a full checklist and decision framework — see How to Use Step 2.

## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Skip

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, use this skill.

---

## Operating Principles

Use this skill as a **UI/UX advisory and quality-control layer**. Do not override:
1. Explicit user requirements
2. Framework-specific implementation constraints
3. Existing project design systems
4. Accessibility or legal requirements
5. Performance budgets provided by the user

**Narrow fixes**: If the user asks for a specific bug fix or narrow implementation change, apply only the relevant checks. Do not expand into a full design critique unless requested.

**Check selection**: Do not apply all rules mechanically. Select the 5–10 most relevant checks based on:
- User goal and task type
- Platform (web, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, desktop)
- Product type (consumer app, enterprise tool, dashboard, e-commerce, health, finance, etc.)
- Accessibility impact
- Conversion or business impact
- Implementation cost

**Tradeoff resolution**: When rules conflict, resolve in this order:
1. Safety and accessibility
2. User task completion
3. Platform conventions
4. Performance
5. Responsive robustness
6. Visual consistency
7. Brand expression
8. Novelty

**Anti-hallucination**: When making measurable claims, verify or explicitly mark as assumption: contrast ratios, touch target sizes, browser support percentages, bundle size or performance budgets, CLS values, font loading behavior, and responsive breakpoints. Do not invent palette names, font pairings, product rules, or chart recommendations from unavailable databases. If local scripts/data are not installed, say so and apply manual checklist reasoning.

---

## Review Strictness

Default mode: **balanced** — applies relevant checks proportionate to the task.

If the user uses any of: *"critica pesante", "audit", "professional review", "production-ready", "quality check", "strict"*, switch to **strict mode**:
- Identify contradictions and vague claims
- Separate objective violations (WCAG failures, broken interactions) from taste preferences
- Prioritize fixes by user impact and implementation effort
- Do not praise unless it helps decision-making
- Mark all assumptions clearly

---

## Output Modes

Select the mode that matches the user's task.

## Quick Reference

### 1. Accessibility (CRITICAL)

- `color-contrast` — Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text (large text 3:1); WCAG 2.2 AA
- `focus-states` — Visible focus rings on interactive elements (2–4px outline); WCAG 2.2 Focus Appearance also requires the focus indicator change to have 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors
- `alt-text` — Descriptive alt text for meaningful images; decorative images use `alt=""`; decorative inline icons hidden from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`
- `aria-labels` — `aria-label` for icon-only buttons; `accessibilityLabel` in native
- `keyboard-nav` — Tab order matches visual order; full keyboard support
- `form-labels` — Use `<label>` with `for` attribute; never placeholder-only
- `skip-links` — Skip to main content for keyboard users
- `heading-hierarchy` — Preserve meaningful document outline (h1→h6); avoid skipping levels unless the structure remains understandable without visual context
- `color-not-only` — Don't convey info by color alone (add icon/text)
- `dynamic-type` — Support system text scaling; avoid truncation as text grows
- `reduced-motion` — Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; reduce/disable animations when requested
- `voiceover-sr` — Meaningful `accessibilityLabel`/`accessibilityHint`; logical reading order
- `escape-routes` — Provide cancel/back in modals and multi-step flows
- `keyboard-shortcuts` — Preserve system and a11y shortcuts; offer keyboard alternatives for drag-and-drop

### 2. Touch & Interaction (CRITICAL)

- `touch-target-size` — Web: WCAG 2.2 minimum 24×24 CSS px (recommended 44×44 CSS px); iOS: 44×44pt hit region (Apple HIG); Android: 48×48dp (Material Design 3); extend hit area beyond visual bounds if needed
- `touch-spacing` — Minimum 8px/8dp gap between touch targets
- `hover-vs-tap` — Use click/tap for primary interactions; don't rely on hover alone
- `loading-buttons` — Prevent duplicate submissions during async operations; show busy state (spinner or progress); preserve a cancel or retry path where recovery is needed — do not simply disable when the user may need to interrupt or correct
- `error-feedback` — Clear error messages near problem
- `cursor-pointer` — Add `cursor: pointer` to clickable elements (Web)
- `gesture-conflicts` — Avoid horizontal swipe on main content; prefer vertical scroll
- `tap-delay` — Use `touch-action: manipulation` to reduce 300ms delay (Web)
- `standard-gestures` — Use platform standard gestures consistently; don't redefine
- `system-gestures` — Don't block system gestures (Control Center, back swipe, etc.)
- `press-feedback` — Visual feedback on press (ripple/highlight; MD3 state layers)
- `haptic-feedback` — Use haptic for confirmations and important actions; avoid overuse
- `gesture-alternative` — Don't rely on gesture-only interactions; always provide visible controls
- `safe-area-awareness` — Keep primary touch targets away from notch, Dynamic Island, gesture bar
- `no-precision-required` — Avoid requiring pixel-perfect taps on small icons or thin edges
- `swipe-clarity` — Swipe actions must show clear affordance or hint
- `drag-threshold` — Use a movement threshold before starting drag to avoid accidental drags

### 3. Performance (HIGH)

- `image-optimization` — Use AVIF progressively with WebP fallback (never AVIF-only; always include `<source type="image/webp">` fallback); use responsive images (`srcset`/`sizes`), lazy load non-critical assets
- `image-dimension` — Declare `width`/`height` or use `aspect-ratio` to prevent layout shift (CLS)
- `font-loading` — Use `font-display: swap` or `optional` to avoid invisible text (FOIT)
- `font-preload` — Preload only critical fonts; avoid overusing `preload` on every variant
- `critical-css` — Prioritize above-the-fold CSS (inline critical CSS or early-loaded stylesheet)
- `lazy-loading` — Lazy load non-hero components via dynamic import / route-level splitting
- `bundle-splitting` — Split code by route/feature (React Suspense / Next.js dynamic) to reduce initial load
- `third-party-scripts` — Load third-party scripts `async`/`defer`; audit and remove unnecessary ones
- `reduce-reflows` — Avoid frequent layout reads/writes; batch DOM reads then writes
- `content-jumping` — Reserve space for async content to avoid layout jumps (CLS < 0.1)
- `lazy-load-below-fold` — Use `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold images and heavy media
- `virtualize-lists` — Virtualize lists with 50+ items to improve memory efficiency and scroll performance
- `main-thread-budget` — Keep per-frame work under ~16ms for 60fps; move heavy tasks off main thread
- `progressive-loading` — Use skeleton screens / shimmer instead of long blocking spinners for >1s operations
- `input-latency` — Keep input latency under ~100ms for taps/scrolls
- `tap-feedback-speed` — Provide visual feedback within 100ms of tap
- `debounce-throttle` — Use debounce/throttle for high-frequency events (scroll, resize, input)
- `offline-support` — Provide offline state messaging and basic fallback (PWA / mobile)
- `network-fallback` — Offer degraded modes for slow networks (lower-res images, fewer animations)
- `container-queries` — Use CSS container queries (`@container`) for component-level responsiveness; Baseline Widely Available (August 2025) — safe for production
- `view-transitions` — Use the View Transitions API progressively for page/route transitions; Baseline Newly Available (October 2025) — distinguish single-document (well-supported) from cross-document (limited); always include `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback and no-motion path
- `viewport-height-safe` — Use `min-h-[100dvh]` for full-height sections; never `h-screen` — iOS Safari jumps catastrophically when the URL bar hides/shows
- `backdrop-blur-scope` — Apply `backdrop-blur` only to fixed/sticky elements (navbars, overlays); never on scrolling containers — causes continuous GPU repaints on mobile
- `intersection-observer` — For scroll-triggered animations use `IntersectionObserver`; never `window.addEventListener('scroll')` — causes continuous reflows and kills mobile performance

### 4. Style Selection (HIGH)

- `style-match` — Match style to product type
- `consistency` — Use same style across all pages
- `no-emoji-icons` — Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, etc.) for navigation, buttons, toolbars, and controls; emoji may serve as decorative or editorial content in consumer, education, chat, or casual apps where brand-appropriate and not required for comprehension
- `no-side-stripe-borders` — Never use `border-left` or `border-right` >1px as colored accent on cards, alerts, or list items — use background tints, full borders, or spacing instead
- `color-palette-from-product` — Choose palette from product/industry context
- `effects-match-style` — Shadows, blur, radius aligned with chosen style
- `platform-adaptive` — Respect platform idioms (iOS HIG vs Material Design 3)
- `state-clarity` — Make hover/pressed/disabled states visually distinct while staying on-style
- `elevation-consistent` — Use a consistent elevation/shadow scale for cards, sheets, modals
- `dark-mode-pairing` — Design light/dark variants together
- `icon-style-consistent` — Use one icon set/visual language across the product
- `system-controls` — Prefer native/system controls; only customize when branding requires it
- `blur-purpose` — Use blur to indicate background dismissal (modals, sheets), not as decoration
- `primary-action` — Each task region should have one clear primary action; avoid competing primary CTAs unless the screen supports multiple independent workflows (dashboards, admin panels, creative tools, or multi-step task surfaces may legitimately have more than one)

### 5. Layout & Responsive (HIGH)

- `viewport-meta` — `width=device-width initial-scale=1` (never disable zoom)
- `mobile-first` — Design mobile-first, then scale up to tablet and desktop
- `breakpoint-consistency` — Use systematic breakpoints (e.g. 375 / 768 / 1024 / 1440)
- `readable-font-size` — Minimum 16px body text on mobile (avoids iOS auto-zoom)
- `line-length-control` — Mobile 35–60 chars per line; desktop 60–75 chars
- `horizontal-scroll` — No horizontal scroll on mobile
- `spacing-scale` — Use 4pt/8dp incremental spacing system
- `touch-density` — Keep component spacing comfortable for touch
- `container-width` — Consistent max-width on desktop (`max-w-6xl` / `7xl`)
- `z-index-management` — Define layered z-index scale (e.g. 0 / 10 / 20 / 40 / 100 / 1000)
- `fixed-element-offset` — Fixed navbar/bottom bar must reserve safe padding for underlying content
- `scroll-behavior` — Avoid nested scroll regions that interfere with the main scroll experience
- `viewport-units` — Prefer `min-h-dvh` over `100vh` on mobile
- `orientation-support` — Keep layout readable and operable in landscape mode
- `content-priority` — Show core content first on mobile; fold or hide secondary content
- `visual-hierarchy` — Establish hierarchy via size, spacing, contrast — not color alone
- `grid-over-flex-math` — Use CSS Grid for multi-column layouts; never `calc(33% - 1rem)` flexbox math — unreliable across browsers
- `scroll-smooth` — Add `scroll-behavior: smooth` on `<html>` for anchor link navigation
- `semantic-html` — Use `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`; avoid div soup — improves accessibility and SEO

### 6. Typography & Color (MEDIUM)

- `line-height` — Use 1.5–1.75 for body text
- `line-length` — Limit to 65–75 characters per line
- `font-pairing` — Match heading/body font personalities
- `font-scale` — Consistent type scale (e.g. 12 14 16 18 24 32)
- `contrast-readability` — Darker text on light backgrounds (e.g. slate-900 on white)
- `text-styles-system` — Use platform type system: iOS Dynamic Type / Material 3 type roles
- `weight-hierarchy` — Bold headings (600–700), Regular body (400), Medium labels (500)
- `color-semantic` — Define semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, error, surface, on-surface) not raw hex
- `color-dark-mode` — Dark mode uses desaturated / lighter tonal variants, not inverted colors
- `color-accessible-pairs` — Foreground/background pairs must meet 4.5:1 (AA) or 7:1 (AAA); verify with tools
- `color-not-decorative-only` — Functional color (error red, success green) must include icon/text
- `truncation-strategy` — Prefer wrapping over truncation; when truncating use ellipsis and tooltip
- `letter-spacing` — Respect default letter-spacing per platform; avoid tight tracking on body text
- `number-tabular` — Apply `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` to all price, metric, and data columns to prevent layout shift on number updates
- `whitespace-balance` — Use whitespace intentionally to group related items; avoid visual clutter
- `text-wrap-headings` — Use `text-wrap: balance` on headings and `text-wrap: pretty` on body to prevent orphaned words
- `no-pure-black` — Avoid `#000000` for text; use off-black (`#111111` / `#0a0a0a`) — pure black on white creates harsh contrast that strains reading

### 7. Animation (MEDIUM)

- `duration-timing` — Use 150–300ms for micro-interactions; complex transitions ≤400ms; avoid >500ms
- `transform-performance` — Use `transform`/`opacity` only; avoid animating `width`/`height`/`top`/`left`
- `loading-states` — Show skeleton or progress indicator when loading exceeds 300ms
- `excessive-motion` — Animate 1–2 key elements per view max
- `easing` — Use ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting; avoid linear for UI transitions
- `motion-meaning` — Every animation must express a cause-effect relationship, not just be decorative
- `state-transition` — State changes should animate smoothly, not snap
- `continuity` — Page/screen transitions should maintain spatial continuity
- `parallax-subtle` — Use parallax sparingly; must respect `reduced-motion`
- `spring-physics` — Prefer spring/physics-based curves over linear for natural feel
- `exit-faster-than-enter` — Exit animations shorter than enter (~60–70% of enter duration)
- `stagger-sequence` — Stagger list/grid item entrance by 30–50ms per item
- `shared-element-transition` — Use shared element / hero transitions for visual continuity
- `interruptible` — Animations must be interruptible; user tap/gesture cancels in-progress animation
- `no-blocking-animation` — Never block user input during an animation
- `scale-feedback` — Subtle scale (0.95–1.05) on press for tappable cards/buttons
- `motion-consistency` — Unify duration/easing tokens globally
- `modal-motion` — Modals/sheets should animate from their trigger source for spatial context
- `navigation-direction` — Forward navigation commonly animates left/up, backward right/down — applies to LTR mobile stacks; adapt for RTL layouts, platform conventions (iOS swipe-back, Android predictive back), desktop, split views, and non-stack transitions
- `motion-state-isolation` — For magnetic hover or infinite loops with Motion/Framer Motion: use `useMotionValue` + `useTransform` outside render cycle; never `useState` — prevents performance collapse on mobile

### 8. Forms & Feedback (MEDIUM)

- `input-labels` — Visible label per input (not placeholder-only)
- `error-placement` — Show error below the related field
- `submit-feedback` — Loading then success/error state on submit
- `required-indicators` — Mark required fields (e.g. asterisk)
- `empty-states` — Helpful message and action when no content
- `toast-dismiss` — Auto-dismiss toasts in 3–5s for informational messages only; toasts containing errors, required actions, or critical confirmations must not auto-dismiss or must be persistent and dismissible by the user
- `confirmation-dialogs` — Confirm before destructive actions
- `input-helper-text` — Provide persistent helper text below complex inputs
- `disabled-states` — Disabled elements use reduced opacity (0.38–0.5) + cursor change
- `progressive-disclosure` — Reveal complex options progressively; don't overwhelm users upfront
- `inline-validation` — Validate on blur (not keystroke); show error only after user finishes input
- `input-type-keyboard` — Use semantic input types (`email`, `tel`, `number`) to trigger correct mobile keyboard
- `password-toggle` — Provide show/hide toggle for password fields
- `autofill-support` — Use `autocomplete` / `textContentType` attributes
- `undo-support` — Allow undo for destructive or bulk actions
- `success-feedback` — Confirm completed actions with brief visual feedback
- `error-recovery` — Error messages must include a clear recovery path (retry, edit, help link)
- `multi-step-progress` — Multi-step flows show step indicator or progress bar; allow back navigation
- `form-autosave` — Long forms should auto-save drafts to prevent data loss
- `error-clarity` — Error messages must state cause + how to fix (not just "Invalid input")
- `field-grouping` — Group related fields logically
- `focus-management` — After submit error, auto-focus the first invalid field (WCAG)
- `error-summary` — For multiple errors, show summary at top with anchor links to each field
- `modal-last-resort` — Modals interrupt flow and block content; exhaust inline editing, slide-overs, or expandable sections first — modals are for high-stakes confirmation only
- `no-window-alert` — Never use `window.alert()` or `window.confirm()` — use custom inline messages and confirmation UI

### 9. Navigation Patterns (HIGH)

- `bottom-nav-limit` — Bottom navigation max 5 items; use labels with icons (Material Design 3)
- `drawer-usage` — Use drawer/sidebar for secondary navigation, not primary actions
- `back-behavior` — Back navigation must be predictable and consistent; preserve scroll/state
- `deep-linking` — All key screens must be reachable via deep link / URL
- `tab-bar-ios` — iOS: use bottom Tab Bar for top-level navigation (Apple HIG)
- `top-app-bar-android` — Android: use Top App Bar with navigation icon (Material Design 3)
- `nav-label-icon` — Navigation items must have both icon and text label
- `nav-state-active` — Current location must be visually highlighted in navigation
- `nav-hierarchy` — Primary nav (tabs/bottom bar) vs secondary nav (drawer/settings) must be clearly separated
- `modal-escape` — Modals and sheets must offer a clear close/dismiss affordance
- `search-accessible` — Search must be easily reachable; provide recent/suggested queries
- `breadcrumb-web` — Web: use breadcrumbs for 3+ level deep hierarchies
- `state-preservation` — Navigating back must restore previous scroll position, filter state, and input
- `gesture-nav-support` — Support system gesture navigation (iOS swipe-back, Android predictive back)
- `tab-badge` — Use badges on nav items sparingly; clear after user visits
- `adaptive-navigation` — Large screens (≥1024px) prefer sidebar; small screens use bottom/top nav
- `back-stack-integrity` — Never silently reset the navigation stack
- `navigation-consistency` — Navigation placement must stay the same across all pages

### 10. Charts & Data (LOW)

- `chart-type` — Match chart type to data type (trend → line, comparison → bar, proportion → pie/donut)
- `color-guidance` — Use accessible color palettes; avoid red/green only pairs for colorblind users
- `data-table` — Provide table alternative for accessibility
- `pattern-texture` — Supplement color with patterns or shapes so data is distinguishable without color
- `legend-visible` — Always show legend; position near the chart
- `tooltip-on-interact` — Provide tooltips/data labels on hover (Web) or tap (mobile)
- `axis-labels` — Label axes with units and readable scale

- `no-pie-overuse` — Avoid pie/donut for >5 categories; switch to bar chart for clarity
- `sortable-table` — Data tables must support sorting with `aria-sort` indicating current sort state

### 11. Interaction States (HIGH)

Every interactive component needs all states implemented — AI default is to only build the "success" state.

- `loading-state` — Skeleton loaders matching exact layout shape for async content; no generic circular spinners for content areas
- `empty-state` — Designed "getting started" view when no data exists — not blank space; include a clear action
- `error-state` — Clear inline error messages with recovery path; never `window.alert()`
- `active-feedback` — Tactile press feedback: `scale(0.98)` or `translateY(1px)` on `:active` to simulate physical click
- `hover-state` — Every interactive element has a hover state (background shift, scale, or color change)
- `focus-visible` — `:focus-visible` for keyboard users; never remove outline without replacing it
- `disabled-visual` — Disabled elements look unclickable; reduced opacity + `cursor: not-allowed` + no interaction
- `dependency-check` — Before importing any animation or UI library, verify it exists in `package.json` — never assume availability

### 12. Launch Completeness (MEDIUM)

Items AI consistently forgets before shipping.

- `meta-tags` — Include `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `twitter:card` on every page
- `favicon` — Always include a branded favicon; no browser default

- `no-dead-links` — No buttons or links pointing to `#` without a real destination or disabled state
- `form-validation` — Client-side validation for email format, required fields, and length limits
- `back-navigation` — Every page has a way back; no dead ends in user flows

## How to Use

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements

Extract key information from the user request:
- **Product type**: Entertainment (social, video, music, gaming), Tool (scanner, editor, converter), Productivity (task manager, notes, calendar), or hybrid
- **Target audience**: Consumer or professional; consider age group and usage context
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: Choose from React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SwiftUI, React Native, Flutter, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, or HTML/CSS

### Step 2: Generate Design System

Clone [skill-ui-ux-Libera](https://github.com/sayitlouderdev/skill-ui-ux-Libera) and run:

```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

**If scripts are not installed**: do not claim access to style, color, typography, product, or chart databases. Apply the Quick Reference checklist manually starting from Priority 1, state assumptions explicitly, and use manual reasoning for design decisions.

### Step 3: Domain Deep-Dives (as needed)

| Need | Domain |
|------|--------|
| Product type patterns | `product` |
| Style options | `style` |
| Color palettes | `color` |
| Font pairings | `typography` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` |
| UX best practices | `ux` |

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

Apply stack-specific best practices for your chosen framework. All 10 stacks supported: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SwiftUI, React Native, Flutter, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, HTML/CSS.

## Common Sticking Points

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| Can't decide on style/color | Re-run design system query with different keywords |
| Dark mode contrast issues | Quick Reference §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs` |
| Animations feel unnatural | Quick Reference §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter` |
| Form UX is poor | Quick Reference §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management` |
| Navigation feels confusing | Quick Reference §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior` |
| Layout breaks on small screens | Quick Reference §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency` |
| Performance / jank | Quick Reference §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `container-queries` |
| Images slow to load | Use AVIF+WebP fallback; `lazy-load-below-fold` + `image-dimension` |
| iOS Safari layout jump | Replace `h-screen` with `min-h-[100dvh]` on full-height sections |
| Blur causes mobile lag | `backdrop-blur` only on fixed/sticky elements — never on scrolling containers |
| Scroll animations cause jank | Use IntersectionObserver; never `window.addEventListener('scroll')` |
| Component missing states | §11: implement loading + empty + error + active feedback for every component |
| Missing before launch | §12 checklist: meta tags, favicon, legal links, 404, skip-to-content |
